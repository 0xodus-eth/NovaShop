/*

Tailwind CSS v4 introduced major changes in how you import the base styles in your global CSS. 
The old @tailwind base;, @tailwind components;, and @tailwind utilities; 
directives are deprecated and replaced by a single @import "tailwindcss"; statement.



@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

The @import "tailwindcss"; directive in v4 automatically includes all core layers (base, components, utilities) for you.
The v4 upgrade removes separate @tailwind base; and similar directives.
